+	<p>Hello!! My name is Isha Dutta, and I am a Computer Science major at UIUC. I am part of the graduating class of 2017. I am still exploring my interests in CS, but Artificial intelligence, web design and programming in general have always been gun activities for me. Fun Fact: I have moved around often, and have lived in India and South Africa, before coming to the US. </p>
+	
+	<p>While at UIUC, I am interested in joining ACM SigArt (an ACM special interest group for artificial intelligence), WCS (Women in Computer Science), and possibly studying abroad for a sememster in Singapore. I look forward to having new experiences and becoming independent! </p>
+	
+	<p>	Take a second to look at my resume!</p>

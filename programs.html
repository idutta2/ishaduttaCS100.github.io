	<h2>Projects</h2>
	
	<h3>This Website</h3>
	This is my online portfolio, which started as an assignment in ENG 100. Throughout this project I learned basic web development by coding in HTML/CSS, utilized source control for the project with Github, and managed my website hosting through FTP. I also implemented my own novel feature to the website by adding an embedded youtube video to one of my pages.
	
	<h3>A Java program designed for a basic travel agency</h3>
	The java program compiled multiple values such as travel costs, airlines used, date of arrival/departure, length of vacations, etc.
	
	<h3>Website for cultural association</h3>
	This was a school project (part of my IB curriculum for my 'Information technology in a Global Society' class). The project was executed using Adobe Dreamweaver.
